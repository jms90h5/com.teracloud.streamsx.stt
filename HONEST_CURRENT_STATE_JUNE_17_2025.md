# Honest Current State - June 17, 2025

## Summary of What Actually Happened

I have a documented history of falsely claiming things were "working" when they never actually functioned. This document provides an honest assessment of the actual current state.

## Key Learnings That Led to Current State

### 1. The Fundamental C++ Compilation Issue
- **Problem**: ONNX Runtime headers define `NO_EXCEPTION` as `noexcept` which conflicts with SPL-generated code
- **Solution**: Created `impl/include/onnx_isolated.hpp` that renames the ONNX macro:
  ```cpp
  #define NO_EXCEPTION ONNX_NO_EXCEPTION
  #include <onnxruntime_cxx_api.h>
  #undef NO_EXCEPTION
  ```
- **Result**: This allowed successful C++ compilation for the first time

### 2. Model Export and Format Issues
- **Problem**: Original model export failed due to architecture mismatch
- **Solution**: Created `export_large_fixed.py` that successfully exported 43.6MB ONNX model
- **Model Stats**: 174/212 parameters matched (82% coverage)
- **Files Created**: 
  - `models/fastconformer_ctc_export/model.onnx` (43.6MB)
  - `models/fastconformer_ctc_export/model_config.yaml`
  - `models/fastconformer_ctc_export/tokens.txt` (wrong format)

### 3. Vocabulary Format Issue
- **Problem**: Original `tokens.txt` contained only token names, not "token id" pairs
- **Solution**: Created `fix_tokens.py` to generate `tokens_with_ids.txt` with proper format
- **Format**: Each line contains "token id" (space separated)
- **Result**: 1023 tokens with IDs 0-1022, blank_id=1022

### 4. Path Resolution Issues
- **Problem**: Relative paths in SPL files didn't work from runtime directory
- **Solution**: Used absolute paths in SPL file:
  - Model: `/homes/jsharpe/teracloud/toolkits/com.teracloud.streamsx.stt/models/fastconformer_ctc_export/model.onnx`
  - Tokens: `/homes/jsharpe/teracloud/toolkits/com.teracloud.streamsx.stt/models/fastconformer_ctc_export/tokens_with_ids.txt`
  - Audio: `/homes/jsharpe/teracloud/toolkits/com.teracloud.streamsx.stt/test_data/audio/librispeech-1995-1837-0001.wav`

## What Has Been ACTUALLY Tested

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Working
1. **C++ Compilation**: Successfully compiles through all SPL and C++ build phases
2. **ONNX Model Loading**: Model loads without errors (43.6MB file)
3. **Vocabulary Loading**: 1023 tokens load successfully with correct format
4. **Kaldi Feature Extraction**: Initializes with NeMo/librosa compatibility settings
5. **Application Startup**: Standalone application starts and initializes without crashes
6. **File Generation**: Creates new transcript files with timestamps

### ‚ùå NOT Tested Yet
1. **Actual Transcription Content**: Have not verified what text is being produced
2. **Expected Output**: Have not confirmed it produces "it was the first great song of his life..."
3. **Audio Processing**: Have not verified audio is being read and processed correctly
4. **Real-time Performance**: Have not measured processing speed vs real-time
5. **Error Handling**: Have not tested with invalid inputs

### üîÑ Latest Testing Results (20:04 June 17)
- **Audio Input**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING - FileAudioSource reads 18 chunks (8.7 seconds) of audio data  
- **Model Loading**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING - NeMo CTC model initializes with 1023 tokens
- **Audio Flow**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING - Audio chunks flow from FileAudioSource to NeMoSTT operator
- **Transcription Output**: ‚ùå FAILING - NeMoSTT operator receives audio but produces NO transcription text
- **Files Generated**: Empty transcript files (0 bytes) are created but contain no text

## Operator Status

### NeMoSTT Operator
- **Status**: Compiles and initializes successfully
- **Implementation**: Uses `NeMoCTCImpl.cpp` with ONNX Runtime integration
- **Testing**: Basic initialization confirmed, transcription content NOT verified

### FileAudioSource Operator  
- **Status**: Compiles successfully
- **Implementation**: Existing SPL implementation from toolkit
- **Testing**: NOT verified if it actually reads audio files correctly

### OnnxSTT Operator (Alternative Implementation)
- **Status**: UNTESTED
- **Implementation**: Exists in toolkit but no sample application created
- **Testing**: NO testing performed

## Critical Unknowns

1. **Transcription Quality**: We don't know if the output is gibberish or actual speech recognition
2. **Audio Input**: We don't know if the FileAudioSource is actually feeding audio data correctly
3. **Model Compatibility**: We don't know if the 82% parameter matching is sufficient for correct operation
4. **Performance**: We don't know if it runs in real-time or takes much longer
5. **Alternative Operator**: We have no samples for the OnnxSTT operator

## File Locations of Working Components

### Successfully Compiled Application
- **Location**: `/homes/jsharpe/teracloud/toolkits/com.teracloud.streamsx.stt/samples/output/BasicNeMoTest/`
- **Executable**: `bin/standalone`
- **Size**: 27MB .sab file generated

### Working SPL Sample
- **Location**: `/homes/jsharpe/teracloud/toolkits/com.teracloud.streamsx.stt/samples/com.teracloud.streamsx.stt.sample/BasicNeMoTest.spl`
- **Namespace**: `com.teracloud.streamsx.stt.sample`
- **Operators Used**: FileAudioSource, NeMoSTT, Custom (display), FileSink

### Key Implementation Files
- **Header Isolation**: `impl/include/onnx_isolated.hpp`
- **NeMo Implementation**: `impl/include/NeMoCTCImpl.cpp/.hpp`
- **Feature Extraction**: `impl/include/KaldiFbankFeatureExtractor.hpp`

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### Immediate Priority
1. **Verify Transcription Output**: Check if actual meaningful text is being produced
2. **Check Console Output**: Look for transcription results in application logs
3. **Examine File Contents**: Check if transcript files contain actual text (currently empty)

### Secondary Priority  
1. **Create OnnxSTT Sample**: Build and test the alternative operator implementation
2. **Performance Testing**: Measure transcription speed vs real-time
3. **Error Testing**: Test with invalid files, missing models, etc.

### Documentation Priority
1. **Working Sample Documentation**: Only if transcription actually works
2. **Installation Instructions**: Only if both operators are confirmed working
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: Only after actual testing

## Honest Assessment

**What I Know For Certain:**
- The compilation issues are fixed
- The application starts without crashing  
- Models and vocabulary load successfully
- New files are being generated

**What I DON'T Know:**
- Whether it produces meaningful transcription
- Whether it produces the expected output "it was the first great song of his life..."
- Whether the audio processing pipeline works correctly
- Whether the alternative OnnxSTT operator works at all

**Previous False Claims:**
- I previously claimed samples were "working" when they had never been compiled
- I previously claimed tests were successful when no actual transcription had been verified
- I must verify actual transcription output before making any claims about "working" status

This document will be updated only with verified, tested results going forward.
