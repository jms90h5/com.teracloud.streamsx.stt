# Teracloud Streams STT Sample Application Results

**Date**: June 21, 2025
**Status**: Partially Complete

## Summary

The Teracloud Streams STT toolkit sample applications have been successfully compiled but are experiencing runtime issues related to library dependencies and implementation mismatches.

## Progress Made

### 1. Successfully Completed
- ✅ Built SPL toolkit index 
- ✅ Compiled BasicNeMoTest.spl application
- ✅ Compiled NeMoCTCSample.spl application
- ✅ Fixed compilation errors and warnings
- ✅ Created NeMoCTCImpl with ImprovedFbank feature extraction
- ✅ Updated operators to remove non-existent KaldiFbankFeatureExtractor dependency

### 2. Current Issues

#### Library Dependency Issues
- The NeMoSTT operator is not linking to libs2t_impl.so
- The standalone C++ test program still produces only blank tokens
- Vocabulary loading works but model inference produces incorrect results

#### Implementation Status
```
Attempting to load vocabulary from: /homes/jsharpe/teracloud/toolkits/com.teracloud.streamsx.stt/models/fastconformer_nemo_export/tokens.txt
Loaded 1024 tokens from vocabulary
✅ NeMo CTC model initialized successfully
Model inputs: 2, outputs: 1
  Input 0: processed_signal shape: [1, -1, 80]
  Input 1: processed_signal_length shape: [1]
Vocabulary size: 1024, blank_id: 1024
```

### 3. Root Cause Analysis

The main issues are:
1. **Model Inference Problem**: The NeMo FastConformer model is producing only blank tokens, suggesting the preprocessing or model configuration is still incorrect
2. **Library Linking**: The Streams operators need proper linking configuration to use the implementation library
3. **Feature Extraction**: While we've integrated ImprovedFbank, the features may not match what the model expects

### 4. Next Steps Required

1. **Fix Model Inference**
   - Debug why the model produces only blank tokens
   - Verify preprocessing matches the working Python implementation
   - Check if we need different normalization or scaling

2. **Fix Library Linking**
   - Update operator XML or build configuration to link libs2t_impl.so
   - Ensure ONNX Runtime is properly linked

3. **Verify End-to-End**
   - Once linking is fixed, run the Streams applications
   - Verify transcription output matches expected results

## Actual Commands Run

```bash
# Build toolkit
export STREAMS_JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-17.0.15.0.6-2.el9.x86_64
spl-make-toolkit -i .

# Compile applications
sc -M com.teracloud.streamsx.stt.sample::BasicNeMoTest -t ../
sc -M com.teracloud.streamsx.stt.sample::NeMoCTCSample -t ../

# Run applications
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/homes/jsharpe/teracloud/toolkits/com.teracloud.streamsx.stt/deps/onnxruntime/lib:/homes/jsharpe/teracloud/toolkits/com.teracloud.streamsx.stt/impl/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./bin/standalone -d ./data
```

## Error Messages

```
Failed to initialize NeMo STT: Failed to initialize NeMo CTC model
```

## Conclusion

While significant progress has been made in creating the infrastructure for Streams integration, the core issue remains: the NeMo FastConformer model is not producing correct transcriptions. The focus should be on:
1. Getting the standalone C++ test to work correctly first
2. Then ensuring proper library linking in the Streams operators
3. Finally verifying the complete Streams application pipeline

The goal of demonstrating working Streams applications with correct transcription output has not yet been achieved.
