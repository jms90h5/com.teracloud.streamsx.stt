# NeMo FastConformer Integration - Solution Summary

## Problem Identified

The NeMo FastConformer model requires specific mel spectrogram features that our custom C++ implementation doesn't produce correctly. The key findings:

1. **Model Configuration Mismatch**: The config file says `normalize: "per_feature"` but the model was actually trained on **unnormalized** features
2. **Feature Extraction Differences**: Our C++ mel filterbank produces different results than NeMo's PyTorch-based implementation
3. **ONNX Inference Works**: The C++ ONNX Runtime inference is correct - it produces accurate transcriptions when given the right features

## Verification

- ✅ C++ with NeMo features: "it was the first great" (correct for 125 frames)
- ✅ Python with NeMo features: "it was the first great sorrow of his life" (full audio)
- ❌ C++ with custom features: All blank tokens

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Kaldi Native FBank (Recommended)

The toolkit already includes `libkaldi-native-fbank-core.so`. This library is designed to match PyTorch's feature extraction:

```cpp
// Use kaldi-native-fbank instead of ImprovedFbank
#include "kaldi-native-fbank/csrc/feature-fbank.h"

knf::FbankOptions opts;
opts.frame_opts.samp_freq = 16000;
opts.frame_opts.frame_length_ms = 25;
opts.frame_opts.frame_shift_ms = 10;
opts.frame_opts.dither = 1e-5;
opts.mel_opts.num_bins = 80;
opts.mel_opts.low_freq = 0;
opts.mel_opts.high_freq = 8000;
opts.use_log_fbank = true;

knf::Fbank fbank(opts);
```

### Option 2: Use Pre-computed Features

For testing/validation, compute features in Python and pass to C++:
- Not suitable for real-time streaming
- Useful for verifying the rest of the pipeline

### Option 3: Port NeMo's Exact Implementation

Would require porting PyTorch's:
- STFT implementation
- Mel filterbank construction
- Exact window function application
- Complex and error-prone

## Next Steps

1. Replace ImprovedFbank with kaldi-native-fbank in NeMoCTCImpl
2. Test with the same audio file to verify feature matching
3. Once features match, the existing ONNX inference will work correctly
4. Fix Streams library linking issues for end-to-end testing

## Key Code Changes Needed

In `NeMoCTCImpl.cpp`:
- Remove ImprovedFbank usage
- Add kaldi-native-fbank feature extraction
- Ensure NO normalization is applied
- Keep the existing ONNX inference code (it works correctly)

## Important Configuration

Despite what the config file says, the model expects:
- **No normalization** (not per_feature)
- Natural log scale
- 80 mel bins
- 512 FFT size
- 25ms window, 10ms stride
- Hann window
- Dither of 1e-5
