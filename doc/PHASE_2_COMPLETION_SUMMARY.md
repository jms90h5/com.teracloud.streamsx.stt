# Phase 2 Completion Summary: UnifiedSTT Implementation

**Date**: January 3, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 of the STT Gateway migration has been successfully completed. The UnifiedSTT operator is now fully functional with the NeMo backend, producing correct transcription output. This phase involved significant debugging and problem-solving to resolve interface mismatches and build system issues.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Critical Implementation Issues

#### Problem: ONNX Runtime Error
- **Issue**: "Invalid Feed Input Name:logprobs" error during runtime
- **Root Cause**: NeMoSTTAdapter was incorrectly using OnnxSTTInterface (designed for streaming) instead of NeMoCTCImpl
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced OnnxSTTInterface with NeMoCTCImpl in NeMoSTTAdapter
  - Changed from `processAudioChunk()` to `transcribe()` method
  - Fixed audio format conversion (int16 to float, dividing by 32768.0f)

#### Problem: Build System Integration
- **Issue**: Changes to backend adapter source files were not taking effect
- **Root Cause**: Incomplete understanding of the SPL operator build process
- **Solution**:
  - Used `make clean-all && make build-all` for complete rebuild
  - Ran `spl-make-toolkit -i . -m` to regenerate operator code
  - Properly integrated backend sources into libs2t_impl.so

### 2. Successful Testing Results

```
UnifiedSTT Test Results:
- Input: librispeech_3sec.wav
- Output: "it was the first great"
- Multiple transcription results produced as chunks processed
- Final result correctly marked as isFinal: true
- Backend correctly identified as "nemo"
```

### 3. Technical Learnings

1. **SPL Environment Requirements**
   - Must source `$STREAMS_INSTALL/bin/streamsprofile.sh` before compilation
   - Standalone mode (-T) is deprecated but still functional for testing

2. **Interface Design Insights**
   - NeMoCTCImpl expects float audio data and processes in bulk
   - OnnxSTTInterface is designed for streaming with int16 data
   - Different backends may have fundamentally different processing models

3. **Build Process Understanding**
   - SPL operators use code generation templates (.cgt files)
   - Changes to C++ implementation require full toolkit rebuild
   - Backend sources must be properly listed in impl/Makefile

## Implementation Details

### NeMoSTTAdapter Key Changes

```cpp
// Before (incorrect):
model_ = onnx_stt::createOnnxSTT(onnxConfig);
auto onnxResult = model_->processAudioChunk(pcmData, numSamples, audio.timestamp);

// After (correct):
model_ = std::make_unique<NeMoCTCImpl>();
bool success = model_->initialize(config_.modelPath, config_.vocabPath);
// Convert int16 to float
for (size_t i = 0; i < numSamples; i++) {
    audioBuffer_.push_back(pcmData[i] / 32768.0f);
}
std::string transcription = model_->transcribe(audioBuffer_);
```

### Build Process Commands

```bash
# Complete rebuild sequence
cd /path/to/toolkit
make clean-all && make build-all
/opt/teracloud/streams/7.2.0.1/bin/spl-make-toolkit -i . -m

# Compile and run test
cd samples
source $STREAMS_INSTALL/bin/streamsprofile.sh
sc -T -M UnifiedSTTAbsPath --output-directory=output -t ..
./output/bin/standalone
```

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Debugging Without Clear Error Messages**
   - ONNX error was cryptic and misleading
   - Required deep understanding of both interfaces
   - Solution found by comparing working NeMoSTT implementation

2. **Build System Complexity**
   - Multiple layers of code generation and compilation
   - Changes not reflected without complete rebuild
   - Documentation gaps in Streams build process

3. **Interface Impedance Mismatch**
   - Different backends have different processing models
   - Unified interface must accommodate various approaches
   - Current solution works but may need refinement for streaming

## Future Improvements

1. **Audio Buffering Optimization**
   - Current implementation transcribes on every chunk
   - Should implement intelligent buffering for better performance
   - Consider chunk size optimization

2. **Streaming Support**
   - Current NeMoSTTAdapter uses bulk processing
   - May want to support true streaming for real-time applications
   - Could use OnnxSTTInterface for streaming scenarios

3. **Error Handling Enhancement**
   - Add more descriptive error messages
   - Implement retry logic for transient failures
   - Better logging for debugging

## Phase 3 Preparation

With UnifiedSTT now working with the NeMo backend, we're ready to proceed with Phase 3: Watson STT Integration. Key preparations needed:

1. **WebSocket Client Library**
   - Research websocketpp or boost::beast
   - Design async message handling

2. **Authentication Infrastructure**
   - IBM Cloud IAM integration
   - Secure credential management

3. **Protocol Implementation**
   - Watson STT WebSocket protocol
   - Message framing and sequencing

## Conclusion

Phase 2 has successfully delivered a working UnifiedSTT operator with NeMo backend support. The implementation provides a solid foundation for adding additional backends while maintaining the existing NeMoSTT functionality. The challenges encountered and overcome during this phase have provided valuable insights that will benefit future development.

The unified interface is proven to work, and the architecture supports the planned multi-backend approach. We're now well-positioned to continue with Watson STT integration and eventual Voice Gateway support.
